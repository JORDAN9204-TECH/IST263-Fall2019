      <p>  For the individual project, I am going to create a website about hotel. For the main page, I will have a “hearer” element containing the image of the brand and a “button” element shows the menu. In the content section, I will have 4 elements “body “main” h1, h2 and h3 list 3 major type of contents, room’s images of the hotel and prices of the room and the description of the hotel services. Also, I will have “aside” and “section” element, introducing additional contents. Finally, I will have “footer” element, shows the copyright of the website. I will mainly get my content from google images and public resources.  </p>
